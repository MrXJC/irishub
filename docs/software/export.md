# Export Blockchain State

## Description

IRISnet can export blockchain state at any height and output json format string. Save the out json string to a json file and the json file can be used as genesis file of a new blockchain. This can be accomplished by command `iris export`

## Usage

```
iris export [flags]
```

## Flags

| Nameï¼Œshorthand     | type   | Required | Default  | Description    |
| ------------------- | -----  | -------- | -------- | -------------- |
| --for-zero-height   | bool   | false    | false    | Do some clean up work before exporting state. If you want use the exported state to start a new blockchain, please add this flag. Otherwise, just leave out it |
| --height            | int    | false    | -1       | Specify the height, defalut value is -1 which means to export the latest state |
| --home              | string | false    | $HOME/.iris       | Specify the directory which stores node config and blockchain data |

## Examples

1. Export the latest blockchain state:
```
iris export
```
2. Export blockchain state at height 10000
```
iris export --height 10000
```
3. If you want to export the blockchain state at height 105000 and use the exported state as genesis state of another blockchain, you can try this command:
```
iris export --height=105000 --for-zero-height --home=[your_home]
```
You may encounter this error:
```
ERROR: error exporting state: failed to load rootMultiStore: wanted to load target 105000 but only found up to 100000
```
When you started your node, your pruning strategy might be the default value: `syncable`, which means your node will only keep the state of the latest 100 heights and every 10000 block in older heights(10000,20000,30000). So you need to replay some blocks on your node to rebuild the state of target height from the nearest older height.
```
iris start --home=[your_home] --replay_height=105000
```
Execute the above command, and your node will rebuild state of height 105000 from height 100000. Finally, you try this command again:
```
iris export --height=105000 --for-zero-height --home=[your_home]
```
